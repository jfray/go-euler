go-euler
==========

My methodology for this thing
-------------

I'm doing this less for figuring out the answers to the project euler problems and rather to learn as much as I can about Go. As such, you'll notice that each of the functions include comments with a Python (or Ruby if it's more sensical) solution that I look to translate. I then use the pre-existing answers in the unit tests to know when I have the solution translated correctly.

I know that this does not necessarily result in idiomatic code, but this is mainly to get an idea of how to work with this language and its tools.

As of the beginning of project 5, I'm going to start doing each project in its own branch and merge them to master


I'm adding this as a test of pull request
As of the beginning of project 7, I'm going to be using helper functions where it makes sense, such as isprime()
