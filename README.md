go-euler
==========

My methodology for this thing
-------------

I'm doing this less for figuring out the answers to the project euler problems and rather to learn as much as I can about Go. As such, you'll notice that each of the functions include comments with a Python solution that I look to translate. I then use the pre-existing answers in the unit tests to know when I have the solution translated correctly.

I know that this does not necessarily result in idiomatic code, but this is mainly to get an idea of how to work with this language and its tools.
